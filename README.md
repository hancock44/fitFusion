This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

* Ruby version
Ruby 3.3

* System dependencies
Rails, phpylmyadmin, MarieDB

* Database creation
Copy and clone from Github

* Database initialization
Run --> bin/rails db:migrate

*Using the Application
Run a nohup command to run indefinitely
When using the app, everyone has their personal WorkoutLog and NutritionLog with an anonyoumous Social posting system

Current State: Needs an achievement system that works --> adding more migrations will be needed. Rough draft of actual application. May need to be edited in format to look nicer and cleaning up the excess code from failed attempts at other features.

Issues: No way to delete social posts but they can be edited. Tried to fix this but nothing seemed to work. Comments also are undeletable along with being uneditable and unshowable which is an underlying issue with the way it was created
